    <h1>After the Deadline for Google Chrome - Change log</h1>
   
    <h3>1.2 - 20100721</h3>

    <ul>
       <li>Auto-proofread is now disabled by default</li>
       <li>The auto-proofread option now warns users about bad things that could happen (the feature is pretty safe though).</li>
       <li>AtD now refuses to attach to Google spreadsheets</li>
       <li>Widget positioning now works with editors that have a z-index set.</li>
       <li>Disabled AtD in WYSIWYG editor for http://drafts.blogger.com (couldn't get it to work right)</li>
       <li>Added an option to disable "no writing errors were found" message box.</li>
       <li>Added a load delay to GMail (should fix widget not showing up sometimes on GMail).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.1 - 20100524</h3>
    
    <ul>
	<li>Fixed a typo on preferences page.</li>
	<li>AtD toolbar button is now in the address bar, added an option to hide it</li>
	<li>Removed auto-proofread feature from Chrome/Stable channel. Upgrade if you want it. A JavaScript
	function AtD relies on does not work as expected in Stable channel. This fixes the Facebook comment
	submit issue many of you reported.</li>
	<li>AtD now loads CSS after page load and only when AtD is enabled on the current site.</li>
	<li>Added a hack to prevent AtD from loading on Acid3 test page. Chrome w/ AtD loaded now passes.</li>
	<li>Auto-proofread no longer activated on Like, Unlike, and Share Facebook events.</li>
	<li>Updated auto-proofread dialog to get explicit about OK/Cancel buttons.</li>	
	<li>AtD does a better job of removing/restoring its widget when the editor becomes hidden/visible. This fixes an issue that affected blogger users losing the AtD widget after switching editors.</li>
	<li>Added a check to prevent WYSIWYG editor proofreader from inheriting properties that could mess up the experience. This means you can edit while proofreading on Blogger and should fix the menu cut-off issue in some CMSs</li>
	<li>AtD widget in proofread mode now lines up with widget in non-proofread mode on Google Docs.</li>
	<li><em>To protect your data</em>, text sent to AtD server for grammar/spell check is now sent over SSL.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.0 - 20100514</h3> 
    <ul>
	<li>initial release</li>
    </ul>
